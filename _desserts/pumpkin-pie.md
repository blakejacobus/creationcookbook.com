## Ingredients

| Serving | Ingredient | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| 1 ¾ cups | pumpkin purée | a 14 oz can is equivalent to 1 ¾ cups; do not use pumpkin pie filling |
| ¾ cup | full-fat coconut milk | see notes for substitutions and more info |
| ½ cup | brown sugar |  |
| ¼ cup | cornstarch |  |
| ¼ cup | maple syrup |  |
| 1 teaspoon | vanilla extract |  |
| 2 teaspoons | pumpkin pie spice |  |
| ½ teaspoon | ground cinnamon |  |
| ½ teaspoon | salt |  |
| 1 Recipe | Easy Vegan Pie Crust | Can substitute 9" frozen vegan pie crust |
| Varies | Vegan Coconut Whipped Cream | (optional) |

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Have your unbaked 9" pie shell ready (there is no need to prebake it).
1. Add the pumpkin, coconut milk, brown sugar, cornstarch, maple syrup, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and salt to a blender or a large bowl. Mix well.
1. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the pie crust. Use a spatula to spread the pumpkin evenly and smooth out the top. 
1. Bake for 60 minutes. When you remove it from the oven, the edges will be slightly cracked and the middle will still look wobbly. Let cool, and then chill uncovered in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight until completely set. Serve plain or with coconut whipped cream.
