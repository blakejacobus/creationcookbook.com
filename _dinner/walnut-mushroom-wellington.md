| 1 cup | Walnuts| Chopped into small pieces |
| 4 cups | Spinach |  |

## Instructions

1. Create filling: 
    1. Heat oil in a large pan over high heat. 
    1. Add in the onions and cook for 5-10 minutes or until caramelized, stirring consistently to prevent burning. 
    1. Add in the garlic, rosemary and thyme. Cook for a few seconds. 
    1. Add in the chopped walnuts, chopped mushrooms, salt, black pepper and chili powder. 
    1. Mix and cook for around 10 minutes or until all the excess moisture has been cooked off. 
    1. Add in the spinach and nutritional yeast. 
    1. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until the spinach has wilted and all the excess water has been cooked off. 
    1. Allow the filling to cool completely. Grab a sheet of plastic wrap, place the mushroom filling on one end and shape it into a 10-inch log. Starting with the mushroom filling side, tightly wrap it with plastic wrap. 
    1. **Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.**
1. Preheat oven to 428°F.
1. Shaping: 
    1. Place the second puff pastry sheet onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
    1. Grab the chilled log of mushrooms and place it on the bottom edge of the puff pastry. 
        - If it falls apart when you do this don't worry! Just reshape it into a 10-inch log. 
    1. Brush dijon mustard across the other edges. 
    1. Fold over the right and left ends of the pastry over the side ends of the mushroom log to help secure it.
        - See [blog post](https://cookingwithparita.com/recipe/walnut-mushroom-wellington/#recipe) for images. 
        - Brush more dijon mustard over those edges, and then use the excess mustard all over the middle. From the mushroom log side, tightly and carefully roll until you reach the other end. Press the ends together. Then seal/crimp with your fingertips or with a fork. Very carefully flip the wellington so the sealed side is facing down.
1. With a sharp knife and a light hand, create multiple, delicate lines in the top right corner and the bottom left corner.
1. Combine nutmeg, maple syrup and oat milk. Brush all over the wellington. 
1. Bake for 30-40 minutes. 
1. Top with a few fresh thyme leaves, and enjoy!
