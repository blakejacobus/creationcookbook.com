    1. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and stir in flour to make a roux.
    1. Add milk and let it bubble and thicken, stirring frequently. 
    1. Add salt and lots of pepper.
    1. It's done when it's thick enough to stick to the spoon.

1. Serve biscuits and gravy by itself or with sides.
