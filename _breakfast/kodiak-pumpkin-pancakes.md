## Ingredients

| Serving | Ingredient | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| 1 3/4 cup | [Kodiak Buttermilk Power Cakes mix](https://kodiakcakes.com/products/buttermilk-power-cakes-flapjack-waffle-mix) |  |
| 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp | Canned pumpkin |  |

## Instructions

1. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together all ingredients until smooth, scraping along the bottom and the sides to mix all the flour. Add more water if you like thinner pancakes.
1. Preheat a pancake griddle or skillet to medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Using a ¼ cup measuring cup, pour the pancake batter onto the griddle. Cook 3-4 minutes and flip when the edges have set and bubbles appear on top. Cook for an additional minute on the other side. Repeat until batter is finished.
1. Serve warm with desired toppings like almond butter, pecans, greek yogurt, or sugar-free maple syrup.
