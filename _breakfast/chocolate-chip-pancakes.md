# Chocolate Chip Pancakes

## Ingredients

| Serving | Ingredient | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| 1 cup | Flour | All purpose |
| 1/2 cup | Chickpea flour |  |
| 1 tbsp | Baking powder |  |
| 1/2 tsp | Salt |  |
| 1/4 cup | Hemp seeds | Optional |
| 2 tbsp | Canola oil |  |
| 1 cup milk |  | Can substitute plant-based milk |
| 1/2 cup | Water |  |
| 1 tbsp | Sugar | Can remove for sugar-free recipe |

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
1. Pour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy.
1. Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.
1. Serve with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some fresh fruit.
